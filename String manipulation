STRING MANIPULATION
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        s.reverse()

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. 
The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
Example 2:
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        st=s.strip()
        sm=st.split()
        sm.reverse()
        ans=' '.join(map(str,sm))

        return ans

Given a string s, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
Example 2:
Input: s = "God Ding"
Output: "doG gniD"

class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        st=s.split()
        stt=[]
        
        for i in st:
            r=str(i[::-1])
            stt.append(r)
        ans=' '.join(map(str,stt))
        return ans

Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.
If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
Example 2:
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"

class Solution:
    def reverseStr(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        l=list(s)
        for i in range(0,len(l),k+k):
            l[i:i+k]=reversed(l[i:i+k])
        st=''.join(l)
        return st
